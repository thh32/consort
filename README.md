# Consort: amplicon sequence variant based analysis of 16S rRNA datasets from minimal consortia



Consort has been designed to specifically for 16S rRNA analysis of minimal microbial consortia. 

By utilising the DADA2 package to conduct amplicon seaquence varient analysis, Consort is able to provide information on both the diversity of each consortium member and its total abundance
